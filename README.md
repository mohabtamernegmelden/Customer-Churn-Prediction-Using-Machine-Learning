# Car Price Predictor – Machine Learning Project
📌 Overview
Car Price Predictor is a Machine Learning project that estimates the selling price of used cars based on various features such as brand, model, year, fuel type, transmission, mileage, and more.

The goal of this project is to build an accurate regression model that helps users predict car prices using data-driven techniques.

🎯 Problem Statement

Car prices depend on multiple factors including manufacturing year, fuel type, transmission, kilometers driven, and brand reputation.
This project aims to:

Analyze car dataset features

Perform data preprocessing & feature engineering

Train and evaluate regression models

Predict car prices with high accuracy
